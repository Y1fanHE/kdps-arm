## General idea of the Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis

<img src=img-readme/problem.png width=720>

### Objectives

Genetic programming (GP) searches a program by random initialization, unguided
variation, and fitness-guided selection. This shows a difference to a human
programmer. Usually, a human programmer writes code based on his knowledge from
his previous programming experience.

**This study aims to build a system so that GP could use the knowledge from the
previous problems it solved in a sequence of problem-solving (shown in the above
figure).** We use sub-programs as knowledge in the current study.

description of knowledge.

### General framework of Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis (simple version)

<img src=img-readme/simple.png width=720>

<details>
   <summary>Details</summary>

   The flowchart above shows a simple version of our framework of the
   *Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis* (KDPS) system. It works as follows.

   - The system saves knowledge from the program generated by GP to an
     ***Offline Knowledge Archive*** (Offline KA).
   - The system creates an ***Online Knowledge Archive*** (Online KA)
     from the ***Offline KA***.
   - The system selects knowledge from the ***Online KA*** to the GP.
   - The system evaluates the knowledge based on the feedback from GP.

   A more detailed design of our conceptual system is in
   [Detailed design of the conceptual system](#detailed-design-of-the-conceptual-system).

### Framework in the current study

<img src=img-readme/simple-current.png width=720>

<details>
   <summary>Details</summary>

   In the current study, we ommit the ***Offline KA*** and focus on the
   implementation of ***Online KA*** as the first step. Therefore, the
   steps related to ***Offline KA*** are replaced by ***Human***.

## Getting started

### Preparation

1. Install Python 3 (< 3.10) on your computer

2. Install required libraries

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pyyaml
   ```

<p align="right">&uparrow;<a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

### Installation

1. Clone the entire repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Y1fanHE/pushgp-adaptive-replacement-\
   mutation-with-knowledge.git
   ```

2. Install the modified PyshGP with the following commands

   ```bash
   cd pyshgp
   pip install .
   ```

3. Download [data files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMT7BjbBqW9iyV5MH0EkhhBivDT8VoKl/view?usp=sharing)
   of the benchmark problems and expand the archive

   ```bash
   tar zxvf psgb.tgz
   ```

   This command should create a folder named `psgb` including data files of the
   four problems at the root of this repository.

4. Test your installation

   ```bash
   python 02/umad.py 1000
   ```

   The above command runs PushGP with UMAD to solve the Small or Large
   problem with seed 1000.

## Usage

### Experiments

First, copy the Shell scripts in [`shell_script`](/shell_script) folder to the
repository root

```bash
cp shell_script/* .
```

In the paper, we totally performed the following experiments. We list them with
the command to run these experiments.

1. Experiment I: adaptive replacement mutation under an ideal condition
   - Prepare the knowledge archives & Effectiveness of the adaptive replacement
     mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp102.sh && ./exp104.sh && ./exp114.sh && ./exp127.sh
       ```

   - Robustness of the adaptive replacement mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp202.sh && ./exp204.sh && ./exp214.sh && ./exp227.sh
       ```

   - Tracking the tested-good knowledge

       ```bash
       ./exp302.sh && ./exp304.sh && ./exp314.sh && ./exp327.sh
       ```

2. Experiment II: adaptive replacement mutation under a realistic condition

    ```bash
    ./exp402.sh && ./exp404.sh && ./exp414.sh && ./exp427.sh
    ./expc01.sh && ./expc02.sh
    ```

<p align="right">&uparrow;<a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

### Check the results

- The raw data of the experiments is stored in the [`02/dat`](/02/dat),
  [`04/dat`](/04/dat), [`14/dat`](/14/dat), [`27/dat`](/27/dat),
  [`c01/dat`](/c01/dat), and [`c02/dat`](/c02/dat) folders.

- Copy the Jupyter notebooks in the folder [`notebook`](/notebook) to the
  repository root.

  ```bash
  cp notebook/* .
  ```

  Now, you can also check the results with [exp1.ipynb](/exp1.ipynb),
  [exp2.ipynb](/exp2.ipynb), [exp3.ipynb](/exp3.ipynb), and
  [exp4.ipynb](/exp4.ipynb).

- The figures used in the manuscript are generated by the Jupyter Notebooks and
  move to the [`fig`](/fig) folder by the following command.

   ```bash
   ./rename_img.sh
   ```

## Detailed design of the conceptual system

This section describes the detailed design of our conceptual system in four
parts, namely **GP & Online KA**, **GP & Offline KA**,
**Online KA & Offline KA**, and **Offline KA**.

### GP and Online Knowledge Archive

<img src=img-readme/detailed-gp-onka.png width=720>

<details>
   <summary>Details</summary>

   - The ***Selector*** selects knowledge from the Online KA. This knowledge
     could be mutated by the ***Mutator***.
   - The ***Extractor*** extracts knowledge during the optimization of GP.
   - The GP returns the knowledge applied into the search process before.
   - The ***Evaluator*** evaluates the quality of the knowledge, either
     extractrd or returned directly from GP, based on the evolutionary process.
   - The Online KA collects the evaluated knowledge to update the unevaluated
     ones
