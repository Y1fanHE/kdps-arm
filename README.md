## Preparation

1. Clone the entire repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Y1fanHE/pushgp-adaptive-replacement-\
   mutation-with-knowledge.git
   ```

2. Install Python 3 on your computer

3. Install the modified PyshGP with the following commands

   ```bash
   cd pyshgp
   pip install .
   ```

4. Install other libraries

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pyyaml
   ```

5. Download [data files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMT7BjbBqW9iyV5MH0EkhhBivDT8VoKl/view?usp=sharing) of the benchmark problems and expand the archive

   ```bash
   tar zxvf psgb.tgz
   ```

   Now, your folder looks as follows.

   ```bash
   tree -L 1
   # .
   # ├── 02
   # ├── ..
   # ├── BENCHMARK.md
   # ├── c01
   # ├── c02
   # ├── clean.sh
   # ├── dat.kgene.rate.csv
   # ├── ...
   # ├── exp102.sh
   # ├── ...
   # ├── fig
   # ├── img
   # ├── LICENSE
   # ├── process.py
   # ├── psgb
   # ├── psgb.tgz
   # ├── pyshgp
   # ├── README.md
   # └── rename_img.sh
   ```

6. Test your installation

   The following command runs PushGP with UMAD to solve the Small or Large
   problem with seed 1000.

   ```bash
   python 02/umad.py 1000
   ```

## Run the experiments

In the paper, we totally performed the following experiments. We list them with
the command to run these experiments.

1. Experiment I: adaptive replacement mutation under an ideal condition
   - Prepare the knowledge archives & Effectiveness of the adaptive replacement
     mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp102.sh && ./exp104.sh && ./exp114.sh && ./exp127.sh
       ```

   - Robustness of the adaptive replacement mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp202.sh && ./exp204.sh && ./exp214.sh && ./exp227.sh
       ```

   - Tracking the tested-good knowledge

       ```bash
       ./exp302.sh && ./exp304.sh && ./exp314.sh && ./exp327.sh
       ```

2. Experiment II: adaptive replacement mutation under a realistic condition

    ```bash
    ./exp402.sh && ./exp404.sh && ./exp414.sh && ./exp427.sh
    ./expc01.sh && ./expc02.sh
    ```

## Check the results

- The raw data of the experiments is stored in the [`02/dat`](/02/dat),
  [`04/dat`](/04/dat), [`14/dat`](/14/dat), [`27/dat`](/27/dat),
  [`c01/dat`](/c01/dat), and [`c02/dat`](/c02/dat) folders.

- You can also check the results with [exp1.ipynb](/exp1.ipynb),
[exp2.ipynb](/exp2.ipynb), [exp3.ipynb](/exp3.ipynb), and
[exp4.ipynb](/exp4.ipynb).

- The figures used in the manuscript are generated by the Jupyter Notebooks and
move to the [`fig`](/fig) folder by the following command.

   ```bash
   ./rename_img.sh
   ```

## Quick view of the results
