## Getting started

### Preparation

1. Install Python 3 (< 3.10) on your computer

2. Install required libraries

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pyyaml
   ```

<p align="right">&uparrow;<a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

### Installation

1. Clone the entire repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Y1fanHE/pushgp-adaptive-replacement-\
   mutation-with-knowledge.git
   ```

2. Install the modified PyshGP with the following commands

   ```bash
   cd pyshgp
   pip install .
   ```

3. Download [data files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QMT7BjbBqW9iyV5MH0EkhhBivDT8VoKl/view?usp=sharing)
   of the benchmark problems and expand the archive

   ```bash
   tar zxvf psgb.tgz
   ```

   This should create a folder named `psgb` including data files of the four
   problems at the root of this repository.

5. Test your installation

   The following command runs PushGP with UMAD to solve the Small or Large
   problem with seed 1000.

   ```bash
   python 02/umad.py 1000
   ```

## Usage

### Experiments

In the paper, we totally performed the following experiments. We list them with
the command to run these experiments.

1. Experiment I: adaptive replacement mutation under an ideal condition
   - Prepare the knowledge archives & Effectiveness of the adaptive replacement
     mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp102.sh && ./exp104.sh && ./exp114.sh && ./exp127.sh
       ```

   - Robustness of the adaptive replacement mutation

       ```bash
       ./exp202.sh && ./exp204.sh && ./exp214.sh && ./exp227.sh
       ```

   - Tracking the tested-good knowledge

       ```bash
       ./exp302.sh && ./exp304.sh && ./exp314.sh && ./exp327.sh
       ```

2. Experiment II: adaptive replacement mutation under a realistic condition

    ```bash
    ./exp402.sh && ./exp404.sh && ./exp414.sh && ./exp427.sh
    ./expc01.sh && ./expc02.sh
    ```

### Check the results

- The raw data of the experiments is stored in the [`02/dat`](/02/dat),
  [`04/dat`](/04/dat), [`14/dat`](/14/dat), [`27/dat`](/27/dat),
  [`c01/dat`](/c01/dat), and [`c02/dat`](/c02/dat) folders.

- You can also check the results with [exp1.ipynb](/exp1.ipynb),
[exp2.ipynb](/exp2.ipynb), [exp3.ipynb](/exp3.ipynb), and
[exp4.ipynb](/exp4.ipynb).

- The figures used in the manuscript are generated by the Jupyter Notebooks and
move to the [`fig`](/fig) folder by the following command.

   ```bash
   ./rename_img.sh
   ```

## General idea of the study

### Objectives

Genetic programming (GP) searches a program by random initialization, unguided
variation, and fitness-guided selection. This shows a difference to a human
programmer. Usually, a human programmer writes code based on his knowledge from
his previous programming experience.

**This study aims to build a system so that GP could use the knowledge from its
previous problem-solving experience.** We use sub-programs as knowledge in the
current study.

description of knowledge.

### General framework of Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis (simple version)

<details>
   <summary>Details</summary>
   The flowchart above shows a simple version of our framework of the
   Knowledge-Driven Program Synthesis (KDPS) system. It works as follows.

   1. The system initializes an empty Offline Knowledge Archive (KA) ***Koff[0]***
      to store knowledge
   2. A user inputs the initial problem ***p[0]*** to solve
   3. GP solves ***p[0]***
   4. The system saves the extracted knowledge ***K(p[t])*** in an
      Offline KA ***Koff[t]*** to form ***Koff[t+1]***
   5. The user inputs ***t***-th problem ***p[t]*** to solve
   6. The system selects a subset of ***Koff[t]*** to form an Online KA
      ***Kon[t]*** based on ***p_t***
   7. GP solves ***p[t]*** using ***Kon[t]*** by its adaptively select and evaluate
      knowledge
   8. Go to step 4

   A more detailed design of our conceptual system is in
   [Detailed design of the conceptual system](#detailed-design-of-the-conceptual-system).

### Framework in the current study

<img src=img-readme/simple-current.png width=720>

<details>
   <summary>Details</summary>
   In the current study, we ommit the Offline KA and focus on the implementation of
   Online KA as the first step. Therefore, the steps related to Offline KA are
   replaced by human.

## Detailed design of the conceptual system

This section describes the detailed design of our conceptual system in four
parts, namely **GP & Online KA**, **GP & Offline KA**,
**Online KA & Offline KA**, and **Offline KA**.
