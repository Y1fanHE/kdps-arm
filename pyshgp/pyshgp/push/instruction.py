class SimpleInstruction(Instruction):
    """A simple instruction implementation.

    A SimpleInstruction uses a standardized way of manipulating PushStates. In
    other words, it handles popping its own function arguments and pushing the
    function return values.

    The first step of evaluating a SimpleInstruction is to pop the arguments
    from the stacks corresponding the instruction's ``input_stacks`` list.
    If multiple occurrences of the same type are in ``input_stacks``, items are
    taken from progressively deeper in that stack. If the stacks of the
    PushState do not contain a sufficient number of items, the instruction does
    not modify the PushState.

    The popped arguments are then passed to the instruction's function to produce
    a tuple of outputs. It is crucial that the instruction's function produce a
    tuple of outputs, even if it only contains a single element. The elements of
    the tuple are then routed to the corresponding stacks specified in the
    instruction's ``output_stacks``.

    Parameters
    ----------

    f : Callable

        A list of PushType names to use when popping arguments from the PushState.
    output_stacks : Sequence[str]
