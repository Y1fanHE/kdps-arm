In this demo, we attempt to evolve a program that can find the difference between the areas of two rectangles.
This is a demonstration of how to create your own PushTypes and PushInstructions.
"""

We begin by creating a Rectangle class. 
Each Rectangle has an float width and height.
This class will be the underlying type for our custom PushType.

Next, we create a function to converts something into a Rectangle if possible.
This function will be the coercion function for our custom PushType.
"""

    return Rectangle(float(thing[0]), float(thing[1]))


"""
Next, we create the target function we would like to synthesize.
Our target function returns the difference in area between two rectangles.
This is also the function used to define of one of our custom instructions.

    area_2 = r2.height * r2.width
    return (area_1 - area_2),  # comma at the end packages return value into a tuple


"""
Now we create another function used to define of one of our custom instructions.
This function returns a tuple containing a rectangle made from two floats.
"""


def rectangle_from_floats(i1, i2):
    return Rectangle(i1, i2),  # comma at the end packages return value into a tuple


"""
Next, we define our custom instructions that manipulate rectangles by defining parameters in SimpleInstruction.

We want rectangle_from_floats_instruction to take two floats and push a rectangle.

Now we must define our problem by creating two data sets of example input-output pairs.
One will be used for training, and the other will be used to test our program on unseen data.

Next we define out instruction set using the type library and the two instructions we created.
Our two custom instructions as well as the input instructions are  defined.
The instruction set will register all core instructions that can be supported 
    using only exec, code, float, and rectangle types because the only core PushType we registered was "PushInt"
For example, the instruction int_from_float will NOT be registered because
    our type library does not define a type that would support the "int" stack.

Next we have to declare our "GeneSpawner."
We pass to it our instruction_set.
n_inputs=2 because we would like the genome to possibly include 2 input instructions.
literals=[2.0] because it will detect that 2.0 is a float, 
    and the spawner will pull floats when spawning genes and genomes.
